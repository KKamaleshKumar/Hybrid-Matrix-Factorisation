# Hybrid-Matrix-Factorisation
This repo deals on HMF, which mainly would be used as a Recommendation System. I have used the standard movielens-100k dataset which is also availabe [here](https://www.kaggle.com/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset).
What I have implemented is an extension of [this article](http://nnw.cz/doi/2016/NNW.2016.26.032.pdf)
